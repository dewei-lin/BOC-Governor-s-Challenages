1,"The business sector covers the whole economy less public administration, non-profit institutions and the rental value of owner-occupied dwellings.",,,,
2,"Labour productivity is measured as real gross domestic product (GDP) per hours worked. It shows the time profile of how productively labour is used to generate value-added. Changes in value-added-based labour productivity reflect the joint influence of capital, skill upgrading, and overall productive efficiency.",,,,
3,Capital productivity is measured as real gross domestic product (GDP) per unit of capital services.,,,,
4,"Labour input is obtained by chained-Fisher aggregation of hours worked of all workers, classified by education, work experience, and class of workers (paid workers versus self-employed and unpaid family workers) using hourly compensation as weights.",,,,
5,"Capital input measures the services derived from the stock of fixed reproducible business assets (equipment and structures), inventories, and land. It is obtained by chained-Fisher aggregation of capital stocks using the cost of capital to determine weights.",,,,
6,Gross domestic product (GDP) is valued at basic prices. It is calculated as gross output at basic prices minus intermediate inputs at purchaser prices. Data on gross domestic product (GDP) are available up to the most current year of the input-output table.,,,,
